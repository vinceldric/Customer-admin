#### Assets

- used [database](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/assessments/blob/master/cpnt200/assignment-2/import-db.sql) provided by our [instructor](https://github.com/acidtone)
- used our instructor's [sample code](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/php-in-class/tree/main/week11f/rentals) as a guide on creating the assignment and was very helpful plus the [in-class](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/php-in-class) activities

#### Short Summary
This helped us on how to connect the assignment to a database `phpmyadmin` using `xampp`. As we tried to fetch specific data on the database and display in on a `php` file. And I've still implemented the partials folder containing my `head.php`, `header.php`, and `footer.php` for good practice.
